Alright, Beef Burrito. I'm gonna give you one more chance
to take back what you said about my mom!
I'll kill you!
Tag up! Tag up!
What?!
Oh, you want us to put the hurt on you?
I think he wants me to put the hurt on him!
I think he wants you to put the hurt on him!
You think he wants me to put the hurt on him?!
Yes, I do!
Did you see how awesome it was when I hit the trampoline?
Yeah, I did!
But it wasn't as awesome as when you punched that hole in the wall!
I can't believe I listened to you!
I knew I should've got out to do some work,
but no. Let's wrestle this stupid doll, it'll be fun!
But it WAS fun!
Well, yeah. But, now there's a big hole in the wall!
Dude, we're 23 years old,
we shouldn't be busting holes in walls. We're gonna get fired for this!
You mean, YOU'RE gonna get fired for this.
What?
You're the one who threw me too hard, ya hole!
Don't call me a hole! You're the hole, you're the one who wanted to wrestle!
Let's not blame anyone! Now, how in the "h" are we gonna fix this "s"?
I don't know man.
We can't fix it, and we definitely can't pay for it, 'cause we don't have any money!
Unless, you have some money.
No. Besides, I don't even know how much it costs to fix a hole like this.
Probably a ton.
Exactly.
Which leaves us with only ONE possible solution:
We convince Benson to give us raises
so we can afford to pay someone else to fix it.
Dude...you are a GENIUS!
Of COURSE raises!
-Okay, dude, here's- -Let me stop you there
because I already know what you're going to say!
HAAAAMBONING.
What?
We just go up to Benson and we'll be all like, "We both want raises!"
No, man! Stop it!
We just need to ask him for a raise and just explain all the-
No, no, NO, that's not gonna work!
What are you, 65?
"Excuse me, sir, can I have a raise?"
COME ON!
I'm telling you, dude! HAAAMBONIIIING.
Noooooo.
Hamboning will save your LIFE someday!
It'll be all like, "What? You're trying to mug me?
No! We're not doing that, okay?
OKAY?!
Fine...
I know what to do!
Are you ready for raises?
How did you get that?
I have my methods.
I don't know, dude.
How's that gonna get us raises?
Aw, come on, man! Look.
Just come check it out.
This is the answer to ALL our problems.
Have you named her yet?
Actually, I thought YOU could do the honors.
Really?
Ya know, I've always wanted to date a girl named: The Power.
The Power?
I like it.
Cool...!
Alright, this time with feeling.
Ready?
Give us a raise, loser!
Hey, it's Pops.
Hello.
Hey Pops, what's up?
Is that the sound of music I hear?
Dude, let's use The Power on Pops.
I don't know,
Pops is kind of weird.
Exactly.
At least we can test it out on him,
and he won't get mad at us if it doesn't work.
Ok.
But let's not call him a loser.
Why not?
He's sensitive.
I don't want him to cry,
I just want him to give us a raise.
Ok, let's do it.
Hey Pops! Check it.
Give us a raise, Pops!
Good show,
jolly good show!
A pay increase, yes yes of course.
Just let me get my billfold.
Butterscotch Ripple?
Dude, I think that just worked.
Yeah, I know.
I mean, if Pops wasn't so weird
he might have given us actual money.
Totally.
Hey, Benson.
What are you doing?
Give us a raise, loser.
You know, you guys have been working harder.
I think you deserve a raise.
We can negotiate your new rates later in the week,
but for now,
how's 20 bucks sound?
Keep up the good work.
Do you realize what this means?
We can fix the hole?
No,
No, we can do everything we ever wanted!
You guys shouldn't be doing what you just did.
What, the flying or the hole?
What hole?
Dude, get to The Power, he knows.
Knows what?
Nothing Skips,
we were just getting back to work.
Dude, kick it to max power.
Using the Power in your face,
sending you back to your place.
Don't look at our crotches
while we synchronize our watches.
Synchronized.
Go away Skips,
it's time for you to go away.
It's time for you to go your room.
Yeah Skips,
it's time for you to go to the moon.
Where'd he go?
Did you just send Skips to the moon?
-Isn't that what you said? -No!
room!
I sent him to his room,
not the moon you idiot!
Dude, wish him back.
But it doesn't work that way.
What do you mean?
I can't see him, can I?
Then we have to go get him.
But he's going to be pissed!
Better than him being dead.
Hey, have you two seen Skips?
Rigby sent him to the moon.
Wait, what?
We accidentally sent Skips to the moon with this keyboard
and now we have to get him back.
I love the moon.
Come on,
where's Skips?
Look, we'll show you.
Come on, let's go!
You take forever.
Sorry,
Pops had to go to the bathroom.
Twice.
So what do we do?
Don't worry,
we got it.
Take us to the moon!
Won't you take us to the moon?
Very fun-
What is all this junk?
Um, don't get mad at me guys,
but, uh, I kinda sent a bunch of stuff to the moon
while you guys were in the house.
A bunch of baby ducks,
send 'em to the moon!
Soda machine, that doesn't work,
send 'em to the moon!
You drillbit!
What else did you send?!
Look, it's Skips!
There he is!
Oh great,
it had to be a monster.
What is that?
Rigby, you guys go get Skips.
We'll pick you up.
Ok, ok.
Pops, help me with this.
Let's go, let's go!
Come on!
Give me a break,
I have to come up with the words you know.
Ok, I got it.
G-g-g-go away big monster go-go...
No!
What?
Dude, I think the batteries just died.
What?!
Hurry up dude!
The batteries are dead!
What?!
Hamboning will save your life someday,
it'll be all like what, you're trying to mug me?
I'm telling ya dude,
hamboning.
I know what to do!
Hold this.
Nooo!
HAMBONING!
I can't believe you just did that.
Use your keyboard!
The batteries are dead.
Play it!
TAKE US HOME!
We did it!
Hey, that's mine!
Nope,
you sent him to the moon
so the least you can do is give him your keyboard,
right Skips?
Right.
And let's have it.
What?
THE 40 DOLLARS YOU TWO CONNED OUT OF ME
WITH THAT STUPID KEYBOARD CRAP!
I KNOW YOU STILL GOT IT!
NOW GIVE IT BACK!
NOW CLEAN UP THIS MESS
OR YOU'RE FIRED!
Can you believe this?!
No!
Dude this sucks!
The hole's still there!
Do you think Benson noticed it?
He won't now!
Dude, you're a genius!
Alright, listen up!
We've got this birthday party today, so...
lots to do.
Muscle Man, High Five Ghost,
you're in charge of picking up the special entertainment.
Skips, you set up the bouncy castle.
Hmm.
Let's see, I'm picking up the kids,
so...
Mordecai and Rigby, you set up the chairs.
Oh, what about me?
Surely, I'm invited to my own birthday party!
Um, your birthday was last week, remember?
It's a kid's party today.
I still have balloons!
We've got it covered, Pops!
Oh. I see.
Dude, how come we always get stuck with the lame jobs?
Setting up the chairs?!
Lame!
I can't trust you guys with something actually important.
You're always slacking off.
You calling us slackers?
Did he? Did you?
He's calling us slackers.
Look dude, we can totally set up all those chairs without slacking off.
Good. Do it then.
We will.
Yeah,
and then next time you'll get someone else
to set up the chairs?
Fine.
Not settin' up the chairs next time!
Just set up the chairs.
Benson's gonna drop his balls when he sees how good we set up these chairs,
he's gonna be all like "Oh no, my gumballs."
We rule at settin' up the chairs.
One.
One!
Yeah dude, this sucks.
All right.
Must be nice to be the boss.
Benson never has to do chores.
Happy birthday Jimm... Just drive the bus, you crazy slop jockey!
What the H dude!?
Can we please just focus?
When you say that, it makes me tired.
Dude!
You sound like Benson.
Dude! Listen.
If we pound through this, we'll never have to do this lame chair stuff again.
Next time it could be us picking up...
The special entertainment!
We are here to pick you up.
Just a second.
...who's at da door?
Whoa it's bright!
You know who likes special entertainment like that?
My mom!
Could I borrow five bucks?
37..
38..
38..
Rigby!
That's all the chairs dude.
There's supposed to be fifty!
That's Benson's problem.
No dude, that's our problem.
C'mon, we've gotta find the rest.
Fine! Let's find your stupid chairs.
It won't open, let's get out of here.
Did you try the actual door knob?
AAGGHHH! You're killing me!
It's locked, let's do something else.
C'mon dude, take this seriously.
Uh! It is locked.
We've gotta get those chairs.
Agh, you see the chairs?
Even better.
What do ya mea...
It's like old school heaven!
Yeah, look at these things!
Ball of Yarn, Lemonade Stand, Hats for Sale, Clap like This, Candle Maker, Deli Dude, Staring Contest!!?
Why are these even here!?
Who cares, let's play!
No dude! Dude, no!
You want Benson to think we're slackers forever?
I don't know. Do you want to be boring forever?
Not cool dude!
Whatever! I'm takin' my break.
Dude, you're not even doing it right. You're just mashing the buttons.
Whatever, why don't you go back to work?
I know, how 'bout I take my break too?
I know, how 'bout I take my break too?
Bam!
OOOHHHHHH!!!
Man, that was just luck.
TEN IN A ROOOOWWWW!
All right let's finish those chairs.
Wait man, what about that one?
Didn't they teach you how to read?
Out of order.
Whoooaaa! This... looks... awesome!!!
Yeah whatever, it's broken.
Probably because people couldn't stop playing it cause it's so awesome!
How are you gonna fix that with your third grade education?
Hey! Why don't you go ask Benson to tell you what to do?
Move over Rigby!
"In the name of all that is holy, don't connect the red wire to the blue wire"?
I don't think we should do this.
C'mon c'mon!
Dude, what just happened?
I don't know.
That can't be good.
I don't know, it could be cool.
Oh man, we're so dead.
Maybe no one will notice.
Oh, who unleashed the Destroyer of Worlds?
Good show!
We better go find Skips.
Skips, uh dude.
What did you guys do?
What? Nothing. Heh.
You ignored my note, didn't you?
A note? What note?
You mean like a musical note?
You fools! Destroyer of Worlds will kill us all!
I have an idea, but I need time.
Distract it!
Wait, what?
Distract it how?
Get outta here!
We're here.
It's the special entertainment!
Hey kids. Get ready for our very special entertainment!
We're screwed.
Get in!
Climb on top but don't press start until i say.
Skips my good man!
I lost my balloons.
Take the wheel.
It must be my birthday!
Okay everyone, press your start buttons on three.
One, two, three!
Mordecai and I got the arms,
Rigby, you got the legs.
Aw what, legs?!
Legs suck man, this is worse than the chairs!
Dude, quit mashing the buttons,
you're messing up the legs!
SHUT UP!
Drive, Pops, drive!
This is so much fun!
Skips!
Pops stop, we lost Skips!
Skips!
The extra chairs!
Dude, you kill the Destroyer of Worlds,
I'm gonna go get the chairs!
It's too dangerous, just leave them!
I don't care, we're not slackers!
MORDECAI!
The button mashing's working! Finish him off dude!
That was some pretty sweet button mashing.
I told you I got skills.
YOU!!!!!!
Whoa, hey Benson!
Before you freak out,
we totally set up those chairs.
Whoo! This birthday party's hot!
So we're cool right?
YOU IDIOTS!!!!!
That's the last time i entrust you with something important,
like THE CHAIRS!!!!!!!!!!
Not settin' up the chairs next time!
But you are gonna clean up this mess and
you can start by sweeping up the special entertainment!
Yeah, no problem.
We got it.
Don't worry about us.
We're gonna take a break first, right?
Yeah.
Yes! Fist Pump!
Listen up pump heads, Fist Pump is coming to Slammers!!!!
They just got out of jail, and rehab, and now they're back,
and ready to rock your 11-through-15 year old pants off!
That's our Demographic get over it! That's right! Fist Pump live!
At Slammers this Friday! FRIDAY!!
Be there or be a loser!
There's gonna be so many losers at that concert.
We have to go to that concert.
Seriously?
Dude, they were cooler in the 3rd grade. But now--
Correction, they're cool in any grade,
but you wouldn't know that!
Probably because you hate yourself or something.
Dude, we don't have the money for those tickets.
That doesn't even matter!
We can figure out a way,
but you're to busy figuring out a way to hate yourself.
Why do you wanna go so bad?
Going to this concert could be the biggest moment of my life.
Wow, sounds like your life sucks.
SHUT UP!!!
Hey guys!
Hey Margaret!
Were you guys talking about the concert?
We were talking about a concert.
Is the concert you're talking about FIST PUMP????
Yeah cool.
Wait you're going?
Yeah I am,
I know they're kinda old but I remember them from when I was a kid.
Besides, everyone is gonna be there.
It's gonna be fun. You guys gonna go?
I'm totally gonna go.
Oh so now you're gonna... owww...
We'll be there!
Cool....see you guys there.
Yeah....see you.
I can't believe you're going to a Fist Pump Concert just for some lady pecks!
Rigby,
Now, how are we going to get the money for those tickets?
Dude, it's gonna be easy-
we just have to work some extra hours.
Extra work? I don't even like regular work.
Do you like Fist Pump?
Yes.
Humph, then you like extra work.
Humph, fine.
Let me get this straight-
you and Rigby want me to give you overtime,
and even though you can't even finish the regular amount of work that you normally have,
you want me to add on even more.
Yes.
No.
Ah, come on Benson, please.
Fist Pump is playing at Slammers and we don't have enough money for tickets.
Are you serious?
Fist Pump?
You know what kind of people go to those concerts?
Whoo! That's right ladies,
we got two tickets to Fist Pump,
see ya later grandmas.
Benson, you listen and you listen good.
Please Benson, please give us overtime!
Please?
What is the big deal?
It's Just some talentless band.
Actually, they aren't that bad.
Not that I'm into that stuff.
We are pretty backed up, though.
I think you should give them the work.
Oh, I agree.
I say if they want to see Pump Fist, then let them see Pump Fist.
Fine.
You can work overtime.
Here's a list of things we need done.
When you finish them,
you'll get your money.
Idiots.
Dude, I'm fading fast.
Don't worry, dude.
We just got to fight it with COFFEEEEE.
Two for fist pump.
$400.
What?! But I thought they were $50.
$50 Tickets are sold out.
All that's left is super-deluxe front-row seats.
No, no, no!
Mordecai, wait. Wait man.
We can't give up.
Fist Pump!
I know, dude, but,
I just don't want to work any more-
Oh my...
Maybe I could work a little more.
All right, dude.
Let's do this.
You're lucky I care about lady pecs.
Benson, we need more money.
Yeah, give us more money.
There's no chores left,
Unless..
you want to mow the lawn.
The lawn?
Oh, what?
That'll take forever!
Here's the keys.
You know where the mower is.
Good luck.
Who needs luck when we have COFFEEE!?
Dude, seriously, though, my eyes won't stay open anymore, and I think we're almost out of coffee.
Nonsense, dude.
We've got plenty of coffee.
Mordecai?
What happened?
Need more coffee.
Need more Margaret.
Fist Pump.
Coffee, coffee.
Coffee?
Greetings, fellow Fist Pump fans.
May we help you get some tickets?
What?
Who are you?
Coffee, coffee.
As you can see,
I am a giant Coffee Bean.
I can bring you caffeine.

Wait. what?

Hey, what the- this isn't coffee.
IT'S CHAMOMILE Tea,

Rigby, get the --

Rigby, come on! They got the tickets. Come on, let's go, let's go!
Fist pump.
Now what are we supposed to do?
Come on. I have an idea.
You morons! Get back here and help me pick up my gum balls!
Give us the tickets!
Uh, Mordecai and Rigby.
Funny seeing you here. A chain saw? Are you serious?!
I mean, what's up with the chain saw?
Coffee! Coffee, coffee!
Why didn't you buys us tickets?
What are you talking about?
We never said we'd buy you tickets.
But we had a contract. Shut it!
You know, at first I thought you were cool,
but now I know that you're both total losers.
Everybody hates you.
Oh, and I just realized something.
What?
Your coffee sucks.
What's up, Mordecai? Hey dude.
Dude, there they are!
We did it!
Fist Pump!
Fist Pump! I wonder where Margaret sittin'?
Aw, sick.
It's all sweaty.
I just threw my shirt!
Bring out Fist Pump!
Let's do it!
Hey, Mordecai.
Hey, Margaret! Fist Pump.
Mordecai, you have to meet my boyfriend -- Slasher.
Hey, Slasher, that's my friend Mordecai.
You should tell your friend he should stop pumping it in the wind
and start pumping it at the gym.
Don't be such a jerk.
You're dead.
Oh, this sucks.
Aw, don't worry about her. You'll get another chance.
Dude, wake up! They're about to come out!
Wait.
Must.. stay awake..
must.. see best.. band.. of all.. time..
Aw, crap.
HELLO!
We are Fist Pump!
One, two, three, four!
Da-da-da-da-da! Dig Champs!
Dude
These are probably the best graphics I've ever seen in my life!
Dude
It looks just like the cover!
Dude, let's play it.
We should stretch it out first.
We don't want to pull our "hammies," know what I'm sayin'?
Hey, whatta ya doin'?!
Starting.
Hurry up, and, pick your character!
Aw, what?!
I wanted to be player one!
Dude
I'm player one.
You're player two.
I don't wanna be player two!
He digs with a sucky pickaxe!
I want the one with the shovel!
Dude, they're exactly the same!
Then why don't you be player two?!
I'm not using that sucky pickaxe!
See?!
Dude, calm down!
Let's play Punchies to see who gets to be player one.
Fine!
Looks like I'm player one.
No!
It's not fair!
You always get your way!
Let's play Punchies, let's play Punchies.
I'm sick of it!
Of course I'm not gonna beat you at punchies!
Dude, you don't beat anybody at punchies.
Yes I do!
No you don't.
Quick, doctor,
both of these butt cheeks are unrecognizable.
If we want anyone to be able to recognize this as a butt in the future,
then we're gonna have to do a complete butt transplant, stat!
Stop talking!
There was only damage to the one cheek and you know it!
That's right!
We used to call you the One- Cheek Wonder!
Dude, I'm bringin' it back.
You better not!
Is that One- Cheek wonder?
I hope he's not trying to play
Punchies with cheeks like that!
Stop!
Don't look at them!
I'll win at punchies,
you'll see!
Dumb Mordecai!
I hate you!
You better not be messin' up my side of the room!
You're ruining my life!!!
Stupid bo-
-ok?
Death Kwon Do?
"Learn kicks, chops and punches in moments."
"Unlock your full potential today"?
Yes!
It's a touching story.
Really, it is.
But I don't know if you're ready
for Death Kwon Do.
Why not?!
Death Kwon Do is all about self defense.
But from the sound of it,
you just want to hit harder.
No?
Can you just teach me something?
Determination.
I like that.
Okay, I'll teach you some beginner defensive moves.
All you gotta do is
pick from the sacred text
of Death Kwon Do
Let's see, we can start you off
with "Bicep Flex of Death."
Or there's the "Leg Lifts of Death."
That's a good beginner's move.
Or the "Pelvic Thrust of Death."
That's one of my personal favorites.
That one.
That's the one I want.
"The Death Punch."
That I'm afraid is not for beginners.
What, why?
Because you only want to use it to beat up your friends.
You're not pure of heart!
What?!
Don't call me not pure of heart!
What about you with your crappy mullet?!
You're the one who's not pure of heart!
That's it!
I'm turning my back on you and counting to three!
Of death.
And when I turn back around
you're toast!
One
Of death.
Two
Of death.
No!
Sensei,
I think somebody just death kwon clogged the toilet.
No!

Time to take this baby for a
test drive.
Oh no,
Bro!
You're next, Mordecai!!
All right, Rigby.
Cry baby time's over.
Come on, let's go get some food.
I'm buying.
What?
Rigby!
He's gonna pay for this.
Death Kwon Do?
Where are you, Mordecai?
I wanna play you punchies!
Hey, mister,
have you seen Mordecai?
No.
Who's..
Have you seen 'im?
Seen..
How 'bout you?
so you think you're gonna beat me at punchies?
Well, I've got news for you.
I know your little secret.
Now massage this foot!
But I already did that one.
Then rub it again!
Unless you want to get punched again!
And Pops,
what's with the easy-breezy?
Speed it up!
My pepperonis are roasting down here!
Muscle Man,
you see Mordecai yet?
I can't see anything.
I'm right here, Rigby!
Gimme those!
Looks like you've learned the ways of Death Kwon Do.
Looks like you know how to say things people are already aware of.
Whatever!
You can't handle The Death Punch!
That sounds like a challenge.
That's because maybe it IS a challenge!
Well then what're you doing up there?
Muscle Man, High Fives,
Carry me down.
Don't drop me!
Be careful!
Leaning, leaning!
Here, here!
Set me here.
What move did you learn?
Why don't you come over here and find out.
What?!
How come you're not dead yet?
Probably because I learned
"The Death Block."
It worked pretty good for a first try,
either that or your Death Punch totally blows!
I'll kill you!!
You're never gonna beat me at punchies!
Are you finished yet?
Not until I smash you!!
What?
Are you afraid of a little lava?
Dude, this is serious!
We've gotta get out of here!
Never!
Not until I beat you at punchies!
Dude, stop!
We're gonna die!
I don't care!
I'm sick of you always winning!
I'm not quitting 'till I win!
You got me, you got me!
You got me.
You win!
We have to stop now 'cause I lost.
I told ya I was gonna win!
In yo face!
I finally get to be player one!
What?!
That's what this is about?!
You just wanted to be player one?!
That's all I ever wanted!
Dude, you can totally be player one.
Dude, quit crying.
I said you could be player one.
I know,
but what good is being player one now?
We're just gonna die in this lava!!
Don't worry, dude.
I can get us away from the lava.
Really?
How?
You think I'm dumb enough to steal only one Death Kwon Do move?
Wha-?
Now, how do you wanna get outta here?
"The Death Jump"
or "The Death Dump"?
Sick!!
Better go with the Death Jump.
Hold on tight.
Look!
Why yes sir,
I have the Death Jump
and the Death Dump right he-
No!
Dig Champs!
It's finally happening!
For once being a huge baby actually worked out for you!
Stop talking!!!
Dude, just hurry up and play.
You're just gonna die right at the beginning anyway.
I'll show you!
What?!
Snails are bad?!
I thought snails were good!
No, dude.
Snails are bad.
This sucks!
I wanna be player two.
I found it in the trash in the back.
Isn't it cool?
Dude,
you gotta stop pulling stuff out of the trash.
It's unnatural.
You're unnatural!
Besides,
this is different.
It's a treasure from the past.
It is a pretty sweet plate.
We should put some food on this baby!
Agreed.
You know what would look
great on this plate?
Chocolate cake!
Yes!
But how can we afford something as good as chocolate cake?
Don't worry, dude.
I think I know where we can get one.
Check it, dude.
Cake mix.
Add some water,
slap it in the oven,
pull that greasy pig out and BAM!
you've got yourself a cake, baby.
I can't wait to eat that greasy pig.
Wait,
how much does it cost?
A buck fifty.
I told you cake mix is too expensive.
Do you know the bride or the groom?
The one with the cake?
We don't have cakes.
Well,
I'm all out of ideas.
I got it!
There's that chocolate cake at the snack bar!
But Benson will only let you have it for free if it's your birthday.
Who is to say it's not my birthday?
Who is to say it's not MY birthday?
Free cake! Free cake!
It's neither of your birthdays.
He's killing us with that!
No cake. No cake.
But it IS Skips' birthday!
Free cake! Free cake!
He's really private about it.
No cake. No cake.
Come to think of it,
I don't think we've ever had a party for Skips.
If memory serves,
Skips secludes himself in the woods
every year on the day of his birth.
So, wait?
You guys have never thrown a party for Skips?
No.
Dude, that sucks!
-Skips totally deserves a party! -And cake!
Whenever something goes wrong,
it’s Skips who fixes it.
He’s always there for us,
no matter what.
I bet,
Skips wants a party!
But he’s such a quiet guy he doesn’t know how to ask!
We owe him a party!
And also a cake!
Good show,
jolly good show!
Benson, the soiree for Skips,
what a crackerjack idea!
You’re right.
Fine!
If you two get Skips on board
we’ll throw a party for him.
We know how to get him on board.
Okay!
How will we get him on board?
I know!
Let’s get a van!
Happy birthday, Skips!
BAM!
Free cake!
No, dude.
That’s kidnapping.
But we can’t just tell him.
You heard Benson,
Skips isn’t in of this stuff.
I know, but dude,
Skips is cool!
We should just go and tell him we gonna throw him a party.
Lame!
What?
What’s wrong with that?
Two things:
One
no surprise and two
no vans!
That’s it!
What? Vans?
No! Surprise!
Dude,
We should throw Skips a surprise party!
Dude, that’s perfect!
Yeah I know.
‘Cause no one can say NO to a surprise party!
‘Cause they can’t!
Free cake! Free cake!
No,
I don’t wanna hang out with you guys at 8 o’clock tonight.
Well, then..
How about later tonight?
No!
I wanna be left alone!
What do we do now?
Dude!
Check it!
We’d just lie to Benson and get the cake first,
and figure out the Skips part later.
Sounds like a cake of the idea to me.
Free cake! Free cake!
Skips totally wants a birthday party.
Really?
How did you convince him?
We told him there’s gonna be cake.
He wants an extra-large chocolate one!
Really?
8 o’clock.
His place.
But he wants it to be a surprise,
so if you see him don’t say anything.
Okay.
Here’s the key to the cake in a snack bar.
I guess I’ll see you at 8.
BUT IF YOU MORONS ARE LYING TO ME,
YOU’LL BE ON DISH DUTY FOR THE NEXT MONTH!
We did it!
Let’s eat it!
No!
You heard Benson.
Do you wanna be on dish duty?
Fine!
We’ll do dish duty.
No, dude.
We have to get Skips.
Are you sure Skips is even here?
Pops said Skips secludes himself in the woods.
Where else should we look?
Don’t touch that cake.
It’s a medical emergency!
You just ate a sandwich!
Are you a doctor now?
Did you go a medical school in a past 5 minutes?
We’re saving it for the party, and that’s THAT.
Do you see them?
Not yet!
Hit the lights. It’s almost 8 p.m.
Skips is gonna be so surprised when he comes and sees us totally naked!
It’s not that kind of
party, Muscle Man!
Don’t turn on the lights!
Man, it’s almost 8.
We’re not gonna find him, let’s just eat it!
No.
Benson’s gonna get pissed,
so we shouldn’t.
Benson’s gonna get like that no matter what.
Better to have no regrets!
Dude!
No!
RIGBY!
GET OFF!
Dude! Quit it!
You’re ruining the cake!
Wait!
What’s that?
Sounds like some kind of..
weird Aztec ritual..
I think it’s coming from over there.
We should go to check it out.
That’s funny.
Usually, if there’s a strange noise in the woods,
you don’t check it out.
Mordecai?
What’s Skips doing?
I don’t know.
But it looks kind of important.
Maybe we should leave him alone.
What about the cake?
Would you forget about the cake for a minute?
Rigby!
You’re coming with us, Skips!
What are you doing!
Fools!
You interrupted my spirit dance!
You don’t realize what you’ve done!
Skips!
You have broken the pacts with the Guardians of Youth!
Gary!
You don’t have to do this!
Listen!
I’m just doing my job.
Wait!
Where are you taking him?
I’m only the chauffeur.
Dude!
I think we just screwed Skips!
And ourselves!
No Skips, no cake!
Come on!
We better follow him!
Dude!
What the..
Dude!
What’s with the babies?
We’ve got to get Skips back to the park.
Shut up!
Guardians of Eternal Youth!
I have brought you
the condemned!
Skips!
You have failed to complete the Spirit Dance!
And thus the pact you made with us for eternal youth
has been broken!
Now you shall shrivel into dust
and disappear!
Forever!
SKIPS!!
Wait!
Wait!
It’s not his fault!
What's done
is done!
But this is our fault!
We interrupted the dance before he could finish!
Let him finish that dance thing!
The decision of the Guardians cannot be overturned!
SKIPS!
We’re sorry, Skips!
Yeah, we’re sorry!
We just wanna to throw you a surprise party!
It was going to be really cool.
We were gonna eat cake..
Cake?!
Did someone say cake?
No!
There’s no cake!
Wait, brothers!
I smell cake!
Do you smell it as well?
I smell cake!
As do I!
Cake! Cake!
Wait!
You guys like cake?
Yes! Yes! We love it!
Give me the cake, dude!
No way!
So, you’re telling me you like
cake?
The blue one has cake! Cake!
Give us the cake!
The cake for Skips!
Mordecai, what are you doing?!
Dude!
Do you want Skips to die on his birthday?
All right!
Do we have a deal?
What flavor is it?
Chocolate!
We have reached a new decision!
We will restore Skips’ youth in exchange
for your cake!
Now change him back!
Done!
What!
They are not even eating it!
They’re just smushing it on their faces!
Be gone with you!
Surprise!
Let the merry making commence!
You guys almost kill me for some cake?
Here, Skips!
We’ve got you a birthday present!
It says: SKIPS; GODFATHER OF SOUL!
No one’s ever thrown me a birthday party before.
Thanks!
So, where’s the cake?
Cake?
I don’t remember anything about cake.
Me neither.
Must be a misunderstanding.
The cake from the snack bar!
Oh, you wanna that cake for this party?
I mean what a mix-up, right?
The important thing is we are all together.
I knew I couldn’t trust you, idiots!
You’re lucky Pops brought a spare!
Happy birthday, Skips!
Yes!
Finally!
Vanilla..
Everyone ready for the barbeque?
How's everything coming,
Pops?
I've been making pies all morning!
Skips?
I made Chilli.
Well I have a little surprise.
I was getting excited for the annual barbecue
so in addition for putting on this shirt
I splurged on some Super Extra
Premium Grade A Hot Dogs.
Oh, it's been a while since I had a grilled meat link.
So where'd you get them?
I got them online.
I spared no expense,
I even payed extra for overnight shipping.
Where are they?
Let's throw those babies on the grill.
I gave them to Rigby.
Oh, are Mordecai and Rigby grilling already?
No, no.
I just told them to bring them outside.
I definitely told them NOT
to grill the hot dogs.
Are you sure Benson said we could grill the hot dogs?
Benson totally said we could grill the hot dogs.
Sweet!
Let's get grilling.
Chillin' and Grillin'!
Benson spared no expense!
Real ingredients?
Dude, these are like luxury hot dogs.
Dude, this thing won't light.
I know how to get that baby going.
Out of my way.
Okay, dude,
I think that's good.
What?
I got it!
Aw, man.
I guess that's why Benson told me NOT to grill.
WHAT?!
I said I was sorry.
Come on, man.
No!
No more "Come on, man"s!
Benson's gonna totally blame me and it's all your fault!
I'm sick of you always getting me into trouble!
I just wanted to grill time with my bro.
Chillin' and Grillin'.
No.
No, don't.
It's too late.
Come on, dude. Don't!
It's already in motion.
Well, put it out of motion!
You pissed me off.
Dude, no.
Look at me!
Look at me!
If I fix it, will you stop being mad at me?
Maybe.
Fine, I'll fix it.
I'll just go get some more hot dogs from the meat locker down in the basement.
Benson will never know, ok?
Fine.
You'd better fix it, though.
I hate going down in the meat locker.
Don't worry, it'll be super quick, man!
I'll get the hot dogs, you hold the door.
Fine.
Meat.
Meat.
Meat.
Meat.
Hurry up,
dude! It's freezing.
I can't find them.
I knew you couldn't fix it!
Wait!
I think they're on top, but I can't reach.
I'll grab 'em.
Come hold the door.
I don't see them.
Did you check over there?
Yeah I already...
DUDE WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
THE DOOR!
Oh my gosh!
I tottally propped the door with some bags of ice!
Check it.
Wait!
Wait! I can fix it, there's a safety latch.
Dude, don't force it!
Benson! Skips!
Help!
Help!
Go!
You did it to me again, man!
Don’t worry! I’ll get us out of this!
Just give it up, dude.
I knew you couldn’t fix it.
Dude, I fix stuff all the time!
No, you don’t!
What do you mean?!
The car,
the shoes,
the party,
that other party!
Stop right there!
You know Muscle Man pushed me!
Muscle Man wasn’t even there!
Fine, I’ll fix it!
You mean, like when you fixed the grill?
Or when you fixed the hot dogs by burning them!
Or... Oh, no, wait, I know!
You mean, like you brought us down here
locked us in the freezer to find more hot dogs?
but, surprise surprise..
there are no hot dogs!
But I can..
No!
Don’t even say it!
Just shut up so I can find a way out of here before you freeze to death.
Mordecai,
I found the thermostat!
I can totally fix it!
Oh, no!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT DRUMSTICK?!
Mordecai,
I’m sorry!
Let me try and fix it!
I’m sick of you saying that!
You can’t fix this, okay?
All you do is mess things up
and ruin people’s lives!
Sorry..
I just wanted to help..
Stop pretending like you do anything but get me in trouble!
You can’t fix anything!
And now..
I’m gonna die because of you!
No!
Dude don’t be mad at me!
Mordecai, Don't die mad at me!
Too..
late..
Mordecai?
Mordecai?
Oh no,
oh no.
I can fix this!
I can fix this!
Don’t worry, Mordecai!
I’m gonna take care of us.
You’ll see.
How am I doing?
Mordecai?
Am I doing all right?
“Yeah, Rigby, you’re doing good!”
Hot dogs!
I’ve been looking all over for you!
Please, frozen stranger!
Can you free us?
Yeah, I can free you.
But you gonna have to do something for me.
Here’s what you gotta do..
Hey, Mordecai!
Margaret!
You look stunning!
Spin with me!
Oh, Mordecai!
Oh, Margaret!
Mordecai!
I’M GONNA FIX IT!
Rigby?
you’re awake!
Mordecai.
I told you I can fix it!
While you were dead,
I found those talking hot dogs
and they gonna help us.
What?
They said they know the way out!
It’s true.
We can guide you out of the meat locker.
But only if you will agree to take us to a barbecue
where we can be eaten!
What?!
You WANT to be eaten?
Yes!
It is our destiny to be eaten!
Dude.
This is weird.
Benson’s gonna know these are not hot dogs he bought.
Look at them!
No! He won’t know! Just trust me!
I promise, it’ll work out!
Do we have a deal?
It’s a deal!
Dude, this is the way out!
Dude, they are not here yet!
We still have time!
Man, I can’t wait for those hot dogs!
Here they come.
This'd better work.
It’ll work! Just relax!
Hey, Benson, I’ve got the hot dogs right here.
I didn’t grill ‘em, just like you said.
Oh, boy, this is gonna be the best barbecue ever!
NOW!
What the..
What the heck are those..
This wasn’t a part of a deal!
Wait!
You fell for our trap!
Brilliantly!
We don’t want to be eaten!
We want to eat..
YOU!
But what about the prophecy?
There is no prophecy!
This is simply revenge!
For all our fallen brother and sister hot dogs
massacred by the hand of your barbecue!
And now..
You’ll join your friends
are awaiting a similar fate!
Help, Rigby!
Bad show.
Help!
No!
What are you doing to them?
Marinating them, of course!
Bag the last one!
Stand back, man!
Stand back!
This stuff’s delicious!
What the heck was that?
What did you do?!
Yeah, Rigby.
What did you do?
Don’t look at me!
Benson’s the one who went and bought the crazy Super Premium Psycho Hot Dogs!
He’s right!
I indeed remember now.
Yeah, he’s right!
This wouldn't've happened if you'd just bought regular hot dogs!
That’s for sure!
That is true!
No, but..
I don’t know what happened..
Well, I guess the barbecue is ruined now
thanks to Benson!
What?! No!
No, I can fix it!
Quick! Go and buy some hot dogs from the
store and make sure they’re regular.
I’m sorry, guys!
Minor setback.
I hope the overnight shipping was worth it!
Dude,
that was awesome!
I told you I’d fix it!
I knew that you would.
Mordecai, Mordecai!
Oh, there you are.
You want half of this grilled cheese?
Is that a grilled cheese deluxe from Cheezer's?
Yes it is.
Then, yes.
How did you manage this?
I bought it.
With money.
Nice!
You know what would go good with these sandwiches?
Funny internet videos!
Dude, check this out.
No, wait!
I know a really good one.
No, man!
You’re just gonna pull up that ostrich thing with the balls again.
No, I’m not.
You’re typing it in! I see it!
Dude, don’t look! You’re gonna ruin it!
Fine.
It better not be that ostrich thing with the balls.
Ready yet?
It’s loading..
Okay..
Now!
Don’t get too close now, pa!
Man, it’s that ostrich thing with the balls!
Why do you gotta lie to me, dude?
‘Cause lying’s my specialty!
What are you doing with my sandwich?!
What?!
Don’t worry.
I’ll take care of this with my specialty.
This isn’t you sandwich.
This is our sandwich.
This is your sandwich, ha?
Then how come it says "Benson" on the bag?
It’s supposed to say "Rigby,"
but they misspelled my name wrong.
STOP LYING!!
Dude, I thought you said you bought this!
No, he didn’t buy it!
Now get off you lazy butts and go get
me another Grilled Cheese Deluxe!!
You ruined our day off!
Don’t worry, dude.
The line won't be that long.
Thanks for saving the day with your specialty,
you idiot!
Whatever. Like you could do any better.
I’m a better liar than you are.
Oh, really?
The only thing you’re better than me that is being a big piece of...
What the..?
Those pork loins are cuttin’!
Excuse me!
Those fine men are astronauts!
They can cut in line.
They fought for our country!
Dude,
here’s your chance
to prove you’re a better liar than me.
Or maybe you can’t?
Look at your face.
It must really
chew up inside inept be able
to prove you’re a better liar than me!
‘Cause you can prove nothing!
You. Can’t.
Prove.
Anything!
Fine!
You want me to prove I’m a better liar than you?
Why don’t we see who is better in lying?
Whoever gets caught first
loses!
Okay.
It’s not like you’re ever gonna lie better than
this..!
Excuse me, Miss.
What?!
We are astronauts!
Bam!
I told you I’m a better liar than you!
Step aside!
I’ll show you how a real man lie.
Hey, baby!
Give me a Grilled Cheese Deluxe and make it snappy
‘cause we’re astronauts and we gotta get back up in space!
Know what I’m sayin’?
Oh, my!
One Grilled Cheese Deluxe for the astronauts.
That’ll be two fifty.
BAM!
That’s a moon quarter!
See?
Dude, that was lame!
Excuse me, sir!
Your Grilled Cheese is ready.
Thanks.
We gotta get this back to our astronaut captain.
Know what I’m sayin’?
Is that your astronaut captain over there?
This is the guy!
You’re the guy?
I'm..
I’m the guy..
Well!
It’s an honor to meet you, captain!
Lieutenant Riggs has told us a lot about you.
It’s great to meet a couple of real
fellow astronauts.
So what are you guys doing in this dump hole, anyways?
You know.
We just picked up a Grilled Cheese for our
commanding officer.
I hear that!
We were just getting ready to take it back to the compound.
Compound?
We were just getting ready to go there ourselves!
Wanna lift?
Sure. We’ll take a ride to the compound.
Come to think of it,
why haven’t we seen you around the compound before?
We’ve just got back from the 10 years
stand in the old shuttlecraft.
Isn’t that right, captain Mordecai?
And we’ve just transferred here.
It’s our first day.
Welcome!
We’ll be glad to show you around!
Now I hope you’re up to spend a 2.5 million dollars
of taxpayers’ money,
‘cause we’re drivin’!
Gentlemen,
welcome to the compound!
I forgot my ID in my other pants.
Can you help me out, guys?
What?
That was my ID!
I told you not to lose it!
Guys, guys, calm down!
You can use our IDs!
Here.
You guys might be more comfortable in these.
Thanks!
I love these things,
but captain Mordecai might not be very up to them.
Don’t you like the uniforms in pink?
Pink?!
I only had to borrow pair that one time from..
Doctor..
Asinoskovich.
That one time.
You know Dr. Asinoskovich?
That’s funny.
Because she’s right here!
I don’t remember you!
Really?
It was one time at that conference.
You don’t remember me?
I..
don’t remember very much from that conference.
I have to go!
That was awkward!
Now come on!
We’ll give you the grand tour!
Dude, you should quit right now.
You’re totally gonna get caught!
We’ll see.
Man!
I don’t think you could last much longer!
I think you should give it up!
You'll not undo me.
Then I guess it’s time when I start lying
at one hundred percent!
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?!
And what tour would be complete without a stop at the
the pride of our compound
the antimatter chamber!
How is she running today, Jimmy?
Actually, sir..
There’ve been some problems maintaining safe levels of...
That’s fate.
I don’t understand a half of that these science types say.
That’s too bad.
Captain here’s an expert on it!
You’re an expert on antimatter?
Yeah..
But not compared to how much this guy knows!
Did you know he wrote a book on it?
We wrote a book on it!
But you did the most of the work on it!
But your name’s on the cover!
Right next yours!
Above mine!
Jimmy, knock off that beepin’!
Actually sir,
I’m having trouble with..
Trouble?
Well,
these guys are experts!
Can you lend a hand, fellows?
Sure, we can!
Go ahead,
captain!
Well..
according to the book lieutenant Rigby wrote,
you wanna turn that knob there.
But captain’s own research really outdates mine.
So turn that knob over there!
But he’s forgetting the recent discoveries he made!
Put those switches!
Discoveries based on his studies..
Hit those buttons!
I never said hit those buttons!
Jimmy!
You’re not doing like captain Mordecai said!
You gotta do it like this!
Dude, quit!
You’re gonna break it!
No, you’re gonna break it!
What’s all this commotion?
Major Williams?
Sir!
We were just showing these new transfers around
the compound, sir!
Captain Mordecai!
Lieutenant Riggs!
The antimatter is becoming unstable!
Captain Mordecai,
Lieutenant Riggs!
You can fix it, right?
Yes!
Lieutenant Riggs can totally fix it!
Not without captain’s help!
No time for modesty!
Dude,
this is all your fault!
What?!
You’re the one who won’t admit that you sucked at lying!
‘Cause I don’t!
Why wouldn’t you give up and tell ‘em what’s going on so they can help us?!
No!
You do it!
No way!
Fine!
What’s the holdup?
Look.
I have to tell you the truth.
I have a condition that makes me
forget everything in times of extreme stress.
Lieutenant Riggs doesn’t have that condition.
He’s just an idiot. Lieutenant Riggs doesn’t have that condition.
He’s just an idiot.
We need you tell us what to do!
Jimmy, what do we do?
They have to penetrate the anti-nucleus
with something solid!
Right!
Listen up!
You have one chance of this thing!
You have to throw Lieutenant Riggs into the anti-nucleus!
WHAT?!
It’s the only way!
Captain Mordecai is too big for you to throw.
You must sacrifice yourself
to save thousands of lives, lieutenant!
NO!!
Don’t listen to him, Mordecai!
DON’T DO IT!!
Do it!
Throw him in!
THROW HIM IN!!
Please!
No! No!
Throw him now!
NOW!!
I’m sorry!
I’m sorry for lying!
You win, okay?!
I won’t lie anymore!
It’s too late, Rigby!
I can’t let everybody die because of us!
NO!!
You thought I was gonna throw you in?
I told you I’m a better liar than you.
Benson’s Grilled Cheese!
You better hope this works!
Rigby!
We’re not astronauts.
If you ever lie about being astronauts again,
YOU’RE DEAD!!
We saved the city, astro..
Where have you been?
I’ve been waiting all day!
What the..?
What happened to my sandwich?!
There were spacemen!
At Cheezer’s!
And the two.. we went down and..
everyone wore sweatpants..
even us..
and then the room with the
bad stuff..
but..
We saved the city with your sandwich!
Why do you always have to lie to my face?
We ran it over by accident.
See?
Was it so hard to tell the truth?
Here're you guys,
enjoy.
Nothing beats drinkin'
joe with my bro!
Right, Mordecai?
What?
Yeeeeeaaahh.
Dude,
Dude!
Margaret totally just smiled at me.
No she didn't.
Yes she did.
Then why don't you ask her out?
It's not that easy.
You wouldn't understand.
I wouldn't understand.
Probably 'cos I'm too busy drinking joe with
my bro like we came here to do in the first place, remember?
Wait.
I once was lost,
but now..
I'm found.
DudeTime,
for men.
What kind of loser would want a bunch of chicks
tearing their clothes off?
Right, Mordecai?
Mordecai.
Hey Margaret.
Didn't notice you there.
Gee Mordecai,
I don't think I've ever realized how awesome you are.
And you smell great too.
Mordecai.
Mordecai.
Mordecai?
Mordecai?
Dude.
I'm buying that cologne.
Why?
You said you would chip in for that awesome new game.
I'm John.
I'm also John.
We're the Strong Johns!
Strong Johns, Strong Johns!
You have to buy Strong Johns!
Strong Johns, Strong Johns!
You gotta buy Strong Johns!
Now do want that game?
No.
I still want the cologne.
If you buy that cologne then I'm gonna lose all respect for you.
Good.
Then we'll both have the same amount of respect for each other.
What's with you?
We had a plan:
coffee, Strong Johns, hang out!
Dude, we can hang out later.
I just wanna go buy some that cologne really quick.
No.
That wasn't part of the plan!
If you leave,
then I'm gonna have to get some new friends!
That's cool.
I'll probably be too busy with the ladies anyway.
Well fine.
I'll be busy with my new friends!
Plan-breaker!
Are you done with your stupid cologne yet?
You know that stuff's not gonna work.
Why don't you get out of here?
You don't know anything.
Mordecai.
Rigby.
wonderful day we're hav-
In your face!
I knew that stuff wasn't gonna work.
Shut up!
I'm not trying to attract Pops,
I'm trying to attract Margaret.
She's probably on her way right now.
Margaret?
I'm over here.
Margar-?
Oh, geez!
Whaddaya got there?
DudeTime?
I knew it!
Come out, bros, come out!
I told you it was DudeTime!
Alright!
DudeTime!
DudeTime, bros!!
Did someone say there's
DudeTime down here?
Can I bum a spray, can I bum a spray?
Who are these guys?
I dunno.
They seem pretty cool, though!
You bros wanna hang out?
I wanna hang out!
But..
you're wasting your time with this guy.
All he wants to do is get with Margaret.
Margaret?
That doesn't sound like a dude's name.
Are you using DudeTime to get the ladies?
So what?
No, bro!
You don't use this to get the ladies.
You use it to hang out with the bros!
Bros!
Finally somebody's speaking my language!
Bros!
Little dude makes me laugh.
Seriously though.
You're pretty cool, too, for letting us
bum some of your DudeTime,
so...
if you really wanna attract the ladies,
we can help.
Really?
We know all about the ladies.
Actually,
that would be pretty awesome, guys.
Cool.
Just point us to the lady.
This is where she works.
What do I gotta do?
we'll tell you what to do,
but first you have to drink
from the Cup of Knowledge.
Sick!
What was that?!
It's definitely not
unicorn slomp!
How is that supposed to get me a lady?
Chill out, bro.
We're just having a little fun.
Fun!
Ever hear of it?
Quit bein' such a jerk!
Come on!
We won't mess with you anymore.
I promise.
Got a great way to help you get your lad.
Great.
As long as I don't have to stand next to that
total loser I'm up for anything.
'Kay, check it:
the ladies love dudes who slick their hair back.
Jimmy, give 'im the stuff.
Here, use this!
FIne.
Are you sure she'll be into this?
Totally, bro, she'll be all about it.
All you gotta do is
lay it down.
Lay it down?
Bro, you know:
lay it down!
Can I help you?
Hey, Margaret..
Mordecai?
What's up?
I'm uh,
I'm here to... l
lay it down.
What?
Lay it... down?
Sure.
Are you feeling OK?
Yeah,
I'm great, uh,
I'll be right back.
What the H, guys?
Not cool!
Chill out, bro!
We're watching you in there and little dude
had a really good point.
What point?
That we're totally not hanging out enough.
Don't worry.
We're still gonna help you get your lad.
How?
By partying at your place!
Wait what?!
Party!
Dude,
these guys aren't trying to help me.
They're just messing with me.
Dude, they're just partying.
How is this supposed to help me get the ladies?
They got you a lady!
That's not a lady.
I thought you were gonna help me with Margaret.
Something's touching me!
Hey, bros, check this out.
Here, let me help you up.
Why don't you ask Margaret to help you up?
You know what, Rigby?
Have fun with your new friends, you jerk.
Oh, and just so you know,
when Benson finds out about your friends and their little hangout time,
he's probably gonna fire ya.
Later, bro.
Mordecai, wait!
Bros! I found a trampoline!
NO!
What are you doing to my bed?
You sleep on this, bro?!
Get off it!
Right after this somersault.
Bros,
this trampoline's all over me.
Help me get it off!
My bed!
Hey, bro.
You know this nerd?
Rigby!
When I get out of here I'll kill you!
Check this out.
What's the matter, Rigbone?
You like that nerd or something?
Yeah, dude.
Chill out.
And have a drink!
Hey, Mordecai-
Don't touch me!
Hey, so,
I sorta need your help.
Why don't you ask your new bros for help?
Dude, get over it!
It's not my fault!
If you would have just hung out with me and played some Strong Johns,
none of this woulda happened.
Look.
I'm sorry about the game,
but that doesn't give you the right to treat me like garbage!
You owe me an apology!
I'm sorry.
A real apology.
OK, I'm sorry.
I'm... sorry!
Is that what you wanted to hear?
I miss you!
I miss you!
OK.
Quit being a baby.
Why?!
That's for psyching me.
It's gonna suck for you when Benson gets untied.
Dude, you have to help me.
Way ahead of you, bro.
Hey Skips.
We have a problem.
Unicorns?
How'd you know?
They peed on my lawn.
So, how do we get rid of them?
Well, that's really hard.
They're like insects, but...
there's one thing unicorns never say no to.
Drag racing.
You guys know what to do, right?
Hey, Rigby.
Weren't we supposed to race some unicorns,
and not a bunch of losers?
You're dead! You're gonna die!
Bros! Bros!
Horseless carriages...
Bros, bros!
..commence!
This is how you get rid of unicorns.
But what if they come back?
They ain't comin' back!
Cool!
That's the only way to get rid of unicorns.
I can't believe you idiots let those unicorns in here.
You two morons had better get this mess cleaned up
or you'll wish it was you driving that car!!!
The unicorn one?
Cold!
And you!
Quit sprayin' that cologne, it's not gonna get you any ladies.
Idiots.
Wanna go...
bro?
Strong Johns?
Yeah.
Hello
Oh, yes, this is Ima Sher.
Ima Sher who?
I-m-a sure glad I ain't Joe Mama!
You just got pranked by the Master Prank Caller!
The Master Prank Caller is the funniest thing on the internet,
right, Mordecai?
Ye-e-eyah, I guess he's pretty funny.
But you know what is even funnier than watching prank phone calls?
Hello?
Hello, Pops? - Yes?
Please hold for a collect call from...
Joe Mama!
Hello?
Hey, Skips, do you have a son named Joe Mama?
Excuse me?
Hello?
Hey, Benson, you got any books by Joe Mama?
Who is this!?
Whenever this is coming from,
I will track you down and I will find you if it...
Dude, he's still on the phone!
He's still on the phone?! - He's still on the phone!!!
Oh, Mordecai, we're the best prank callers ever, aren't we?
Yeah, second best.
What!? Uh! Did you not hear what we just did?
We were hilarious!
Yeah, we were. But we're not number one until we do this.
Who you calling?
The Master Prank Caller.
Holy crap!
Hang up that phone!
You think your little pranks are funny, huh?
You think they're funny?
Well, what do you guys think of my prank?
Ring, ring. Hello, what's that?
Mordecai and Rigby are banned from using the house phone?
Okay.
Good luck making your prank calls now!
Dude, let's go use Pops' phone.
Pops, can we borrow your phone?
Oh, I would, but I'm holding to talk to Joe Mama!
But you're welcome to use the phones under my bed.
Aww, cool! What kind are they?
Aw! 80's cellphones!
Cool. Thanks, Pops.
Oh, and boys... do be careful.
I think they might cause brain tumors.
All right. Now let's prank the Master Prank Caller.
Okay, here I go.
Hello? - Yeah, this is, uh, pizza delivery guy?
I have 50 pizzas here you ordered.
Sounds great. Bring em' over.
Uh, you ordered 50 pizzas?
Yeah, and hot wings.
Get here quick, okay?
Your mom's like totally starving.
Yeah, uh, okay. I got to go.
Let me take a crack at it.
Hello?
Hi, this is Stan. - Stan who?
Stan... Stanminson.
Your name is Stan Stanminson?
Uh... yep.
Well, congrats. That's the stupidest fake name I've ever heard.
And what happened to your unfunny fake voice?
I don't know.
Now listen up, stop calling here or I'm going to make you sorry!
Woah, this guy's good.
I don't know, maybe we shouldn't do this.
What, you givin' up?
Dude, we can prank this guy.
Do you want to be this guy's son,
or do you want to be number one?
Let's do it.
Hello, Master Prank Caller, this is... - Heard it.
Yeah buddy, its Joe Ma.. - Heard it.
Yeah, hello... - You got anything original?
"Yeah hello?"
Dude, that was the worst try yet!
Time to put an end to this junk fest.
Looks like the junk fest just got a new member.
Yeah right, like your 50 pizzas thing was way better!
Whatever Stan Manastan, man.
Nice try, dude. I know it's you.
Uh... not me, dude.
Hello?
Is this the pizza guy or Stan Stanminson?
Uh... both.
I thought i told you to leave me alone.
Now I'm going to prank you so hard,
your both going to poop a duke.
they want their cell phones back!
Where are we?
Dude, I think we're back at the park.
Are we?
What do you mean?
Dude, all the trees are small,
and look at that park bench, it's so new looking.
I'm telling you, something weird's going on.
Look there's Pops. Let's go ask him.
Pops! Hey Pops,
can you tell Rigby here that everything is fine?
What now?
Why does Pops look so young?
Now then, who are you gentlemen?
How do you know my name?
Pops! It's us, Mordecai and Rigby.
But I've never met either of you gentlemen in my entire life.
What?
I'm telling you, dude, something weird's going on here.
Hey, guys! - What?
Do you notice anything strange going on around here?
Is he getting fresh with us?
Yo, I think he's up in our threads, homefry.
That dillweed just barfed me out.
Fresh? Barf me out? Homefries?
We're in the 80s, dude!
Pops, what year is this?
Well, it's 1982, of course.
See?
Dude, this is bad.
I know. I don't even like the 80s that much!
The only way were going to get back is that
we prank him harder than he pranked us.
Let's do it.
Hello?
The 60s called, they want their..
What did I tell you about calling me?!
Hang up! Hang up! - I can't!
You couldn't leave me alone.
Now you're gonna pay!
We should get out of here.
The cart!
Hello?
The 80s called. They still want ya!
Aw, man, these aren't even the cool clothes from the 80s!
Listen, just leave us alone, will ya?!
Don't ever hang up on me!
Dude, you have to call somebody to help us prank this guy!
Who?!
Just call somebody!
Ooh, telephone!
Hello?
Pops, you got to help us, we're stuck in the 80s!
Who are you talking to?
Why it's Mordecai and Rigby.
They're stuck in the 1980s.
Oh, really?
Hello?
Benson, you got to help us! We're stuck in 1982!
That's really something, Mordecai.
Crap, he thinks we're pranking him!
What?! Give me that!
The 80s called, they want their cell phones back!
What just happened?!
We need your help to prank the Master Prank Caller.
Who?
Why did you prank him?
I'll take care of this.
Hello?
Nice ride... but I like mine better.
Forget the phone, hold the wheel steady!
Don't answer it, don't answer!
Mordecai! Look out!
Dude, we just hit past Pops!
Can I help you with anything?
Dude. I got an idea.
Quick, get to the field! Everybody hide!
Over there!
Man, I hope this works.
It will, Mordecai.
It has to.
Hello?
This is The Master Prank Caller telling you--
Hello?
I said this is The Master Prank-- - Hello?
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
I said this is The Master Prank Caller!
Hello, hello, are you there?
I SAID--
Just kidding. You just got pranked, loser!
NOOOOOOO--!!!
Now!
Now, Rigby, hit the power button!
Who's the best prank caller now, jerk-dish?!
No! NO! NOOOOO--!!!
In your face!
Who's the master prank caller now, you loser?!
Guys, this is it,
Guys, this is it, it's the way back! Come on!
One of these doors leads us back to the present.
There it is.
Wait.
You guys were better than me today,
but you can't leave me here.
All I ever wanted to do was make prank calls like you.
Was that so wrong?
Hello?
1, 2, 3!
The 70s called: they want their chair back!
Dude! I'm open, I'm open, dude!
Go long, dude!
Touchdown, sock faces!
Hey, you two!
Quit fooling around, we're having an emergency meeting.
Aw, what?
Outside, now!
Alright, everyone.
I got some bad news.
The park is being audited.
Pops tried to pay the park taxes...
...with lollipops.
But I gave them more than enough!
We already went over this, Pops.
You pay taxes with money, not lollipops.
What's the big deal? It's not like an audit is a bad thing.
It is a bad thing, Rigby.
If we don't take care of this,
the government takes our stuff away!
Okay, we only have till 3 to stop the audit.
Does anyone know someone who can help us?
Anybody?
Anybody at all?
I know someone who can help.
If you say your mom, you're fired!
MY MOM!
GET OUT! - It was worth it!
Hey! We know someone!
We do?
No! No way!
What?! If you know somebody, you've got to tell me.
Rigby has a brother.
And he's an accountant.
Shut up!
Dude, what do you have against Don?
Guys! Guys! Guys!
Watch me blow out the candles, guys!
Hey, Rigby!
Happy birthday, bro!
Wha?! Wha?! I told you to stay in the basement!
Oh! Sorry, Rigby.
I just wanted to give you some birthday sugar.
I don't want your freakin' sugar!
I'll give you some sugar, Don.
Yeah, me too!
Don't you dare!
I'm just getting some sugar, dude!
Besides, Don is cool.
You're the best, Don!
Yeah. Don really made that party.
Call your brother! - No!
Call your brother! - No! I hate him!
Fine. Mordecai, you call him.
You better not!
Dude, he could save the park!
Dude, he could ruin my life!
If he comes, I'm gonna tell him to leave!
No, you won't! You be nice to your brother or you're FIRED!
Call him.
Dude, just be cool until he stops the audit.
You guys are making a big mistake!
Don't ruin this for us, Rigby.
Really nice car.
He looks just like Rigby!
Did somebody order an accountant?
Thank you so much for coming on such short notice.
I'm Benson.
Benson! Give me some sugar.
Nice to meet you.
Hey, who's this guy? - I'm Pops.
Pops! Give me some sugar.
Don. Good to meet ya.
Look at this sugar shack.
Come here, guy!
I haven't seen you in forever.
Yeah, I know!
Oh, it's been forever.
Rigby...
give me some sugar, bro.
Don't you have taxis to do?
Why don't you get to it?
He was always greedy with the sugar.
I can't wait for you to get out of my life!
What, bro?
You keep your mouth shut!
Nothing.
So then I said,
"you're not an accountant, you're an account-can't!"
I didn't realize accounting could be so fascinating.
I'm just lucky I get do what I love.
"Ohh, I'm just lucky I get to do what I love."
Rigbone! Sugar?
Shouldn't you be fixing the augit?
You mean the audit?
Don't correct me! I know what it is!
Whoa, there.
I'm sensing some tension, bro.
I think it's time we all take a well-deserved break.
Mordo! Go long!
I got it!
Hello, "Mordo".
Enjoying your game?
Uh, sure, dude.
Can you pass the ball?
Rigby! - He's not even doing the dabit!
It's audit!
Rigby, why don't you just try being nice to your brother?
He's actually pretty cool.
You don't get it! He...
Hey, Mordo! We playing or what?!
Uh, yeah, coming!
Ah, I just about got this.
With a few minutes to spare.
Rigbone!
How about a little pre-saving the park sugar?
You know, for almost being done saving the park?
NO!
What's going on with us?
You never give me some sugar.
Did I do something?
Yeah. You were born!
That's heavy.
I gotta get out of here.
Dude? No, wait Don!
I'm sorry. I just gotta get out of here.
Dude, what are you doing? He was almost done!
Ah, he's not so cool.
I can finish this up myself.
OK.
Mordecai! Help!
What did you do?
I don't know!
This doesn't make any sense.
No, no, no!
Don, we brought you a cake.
It's almost three - were you able to stop the audit?
Uh, almost done, Benson-bone.
How do I send this thing?
No dude, just call your brother back.
No! I hate him!
Don't... Don't send it! Don't!
Must... push... send!
Crap!
You are late. Begin audit.
Oh, my...
Where's Don?!
Don! Wait!
What happened?!
Rigby blew it! He wouldn't give Don sugar.
What? Go give him some sugar!
Never!
Rigby? Rigby!
Rigby!
Rigby's not here right now.
Quit being so selfish!
The park's disappearing, you have to end this.
Don't tell me what to do!
You don't know what it's like to have a brother, so you don't know!
You're right. I don't have a brother.
But I kinda know what it's like...
cos I have you, dude.
You're like my brother.
Really?
Yeah. You're to me like Don is to you.
I think you're kinda awkward to look at,
and you embarrass me all the time,
and I wish I could trade you in for someone else.
But I don't.
Because you're like my brother.
With brothers you always gotta make do.
And I think you should make do, too.
Now will you please get Don to stop this audit?
Look, I'm glad you guys stopped by but...
I just can't finish the audit.
I'm sorry.
Don, please!
I need your help with the augit, bro.
Why is it so hard for you to give me sugar?
Why do you hate me?
He's mad about the birthday party.
No!
It wasn't just the birthday party.
It's everything.
I'm always in your shadow.
You're so much better than me.
Everyone likes you better,
and to top it all off,
everyone thinks you're my older brother.
I'm the older brother! Me!
Why do all my friends think you're so much cooler than me?
I... I had no idea.
I'm sorry, bro!
I didn't mean to steal your friends!
I was just trying to be cool like you.
Huh?
I've always looked up to you, bro.
I get my hair cut like you,
I try to look like you,
and I don't wear clothes, just like you!
Remember when you started walking around naked?
I thought you were so cool.
Yeah, dude. That was pretty cool.
Alright.
Let's go save your park!
Where's the computer?
Jeez! What did you do, bro?
I tried to do the taxis!
Hold on - this is gonna be close.
Alright, I got it!
I just have to do one more thing.
Do it!
Why isn't anything happening?
Because...
I still need some sugar, bro!
WHAT?! - Rigby!
Aw, Don!
Do you have to leave already?
Sorry, Mordo,
but an accountant's work is never done.
Thanks for everything, Don.
Do come back soon!
Well, big brother, if you ever need some sugar,
you know who to call.
Later, gators!
Sugar?
Shut up!
Augh, this sucks.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means that the next time we get to pick our job for the day,
I get to pick.
Why did you pick the snack bar?
This is like the worst job at the park, dude!
I think it's the funnest job at the park.
You don't really think that.
You just don't want to admit that you're wrong.
Why would I admit something that I'm not?
Dude, seriously,
this is more boring that watching you trying to read a children's book.
Is it more boring than your face?
I don't know, is it more boring than my fist in your face?
Is it more boring than my fist in your face, you turd?
You're a turd! - No, you're a turd!
You're the turd!
Mordecai, Rigby, stop.
We can all be turds!
Oh, hey Pops.
So, how do you like being the guardians of the snacks?
It's awesome. - This place is lame.
But Mordecai, don't you like eating snacks for free?
What?
When I work here, all the snacks are free!
I guess this means I was right about the snack bar.
I need to eat something healthy. Like a salad or something.
What?! Are you kidding?
Dude, all these snacks are free, dude.
Trust me.
If we keep eating, we'll feel better in no time.
If we eat more, we'll feel better?
Dude, quit being a loser.
Loser?!
I don't know if I want to listen to the guy
who was wrong about the snack bar being cool.
No, I think I'd rather listen to the guy
who's right all the time. ME.
Sick!
I feel so much better.
So do I.
No!
Dude, I'm telling you.
If you keep eating like that, your body's gonna quit on you.
Stop talking!
Whatever. I'm just trying to help.
I'll show him.
Why isn't more food working?!
One more should do it...
What are you doing?!
Aww, let me back in!
Wait! Come back!
Whatever!
I'm just gonna chill inside this bucket!
Mordecai! Mordecai!
Aww, SICK!
What the heck is that?!
Who's the loser now, Mordecai?
Wait... Rigby?!
Dude, in your face! I was right!
My stomach doesn't even hurt anymore.
That's because you don't even have a BODY anymore!
Dude, this is bad.
Yeah, bad like good!
Now shovel some cheese curls into my trash hole!
You'd better hope Skips knows how to fix this.
What happened to his body?
Dude, I don't know, it's like ditched him or something
from eating too much junk food.
Well, it looks like it's not that big of a deal,
if he doesn't mind being a bodiless consciousness for the rest of his life.
It's cool, I don't mind.
What?! No!
Dude, quit being a loser.
Since when does being right make you a--
Skips, what do we have to do?
I can't let him stay like this.
That's a bit tougher.
Once the body departs,
you only have till sunset to get it back.
You know where it is?
No.
Then we'll have to find it. Let's go.
We'll be right back, Rigby. Just stay here.
What? Where ya goin'?
At least shovel some cheese curls into my trash hole.
Guys? Guys?
I guess it is kinda hard to move around without my body.
What's it doing?
Eating a salad.
Rush him on the count of three.
Okay.
One....two....
Hey, guys! What's up?
No!
We told you to stay put!
Ugh! Rigby, you scared it away!
Oh, don't worry about that!
Remember how I said I don't need it?
Well, I was right again!
Dude, check it!
It's a trash can and a roller skates!
I can't believe you!
Please, just stay put!
All this being right is making me hungry.
This. Sucks!
Wait, what is that?
Gimme some snacks!
What are you?!
Looks like a bucket of diarrhea.
It's me, Rigby!
Oh, man!
That boot with wheels stole Rigby's voice!
No, I didn't steal anything.
You're not stealing these voices.
C'mon Five, let's bam!
Come back!
No way, bro!
It's me, Rigby!
Aw, man.
He's close.
I'll take care of the body. You go find Rigby.
We don't have much time.
Rigby! Rigby!
Where is he?
Have you guys seen Rigby?
No. Have you seen a magic garbage can?
We need to beat the living-
Magic garbage can? That was Rigby!
Which way did he go?
Rigby!
Help! - No-one can hear you.
Who's there? - Don't worry.
just another bodiless consciousness.
Hey, did you work out way too hard, too?
N... no. I ate too much junk food.
Yep, that'll do it.
Me? I was a bodybuilder.
I could have gone pro.
My friend kept telling me,
"If you keep pumpin' iron like that,
your body's gonna quit on you!"
I told him he was full of it!
But I didn't get my body back in time and now look at me:
stuck with a basketball for a body.
Yeah, well, my body's still good.
Wait, your body's still good?
Well, whatcha doin' in here, dummy?
I... - You must not want it.
You mind if I take it?
No! - Don't worry, I'll find it.
So long, sucka!
No!!!
Mordecai!
You were right and I was wrong!
I'm sorry for being such a loser.
Please help me get my body back!
Don't wory, dude. I think we can get it back in time.
And even if we mess up, you've always got this.
But seriously, dude, I want my old body back.
Skips, I found Rigby.
I found the body, but you'd better hurry.
We got a problem.
Body, you're worthless!
I can't believe you can't do a simple clean and jerk!
Hey! What are you doin' with my body?!
Oh, it's you! Whaddaya think?
Pretty cool, huh?
No, not pretty cool.
You dress me like a loser!
Aw, you don't like weightlifting singlets?
No wonder your body left you.
Oh well. Now it's not you anymore...
it's me!
Gimme back my body!
Finders keepers.
Skips!
We tried it the nice way.
Now we do it the Skips way.
So long, suckers!
He's too fast.
Are you having a game of tag, turds?
I really wish you wouldn't teach him those words.
Pops, slide over.
I'll take it from here!
Rigby! No!
It's too steep. We'll have to go around.
Give me my body back!
No! Get off me!
Get outta my body!
you get outta the body, you worm!
Aw, man, my mouth was open!
Dude, we did it! I got my body back!
Are you... sure you still... want it?
I'll never treat you like that again.
Quick! Before the sun sets!
Glorious.
Dude. How do you feel?
Well Mordecai, I guess you were right about the snack bar being lame.
Especially now that we're not into eating all the free snacks.
Oh, about that. Those snacks weren't free.
What? - Turns out only Pops gets snacks for free.
Pops? - Yeah.
And I guess we're supposed to work here for the next six months
just to pay for it all.
Turds!
Dude! Check it out, man! They're here!
What's here?
Our fake band t-Shirts that we ordered from that site last night.
What?
Last night, I asked you if you wanted to be in a band and you said...
Yes! I wanna be in a band with you.
Alright, but we gotta have a cool band name.
What do you think of "Cool Dudes"?
"Face Punch."
"Rad 'N' Subtract."
"Helicopter Crash."
What about "Mustache Cash Stash"?
That's it! That's it!
Order the shirts! Order the shirts!
Oh yeah, T-Shirts.
Check it out! Bam!
Mordecai and the Rigbys?
What happened to Mustache Cash Stash?!
I changed it. Awesome, right?
But that's just our names!
We aren't really going to wear these around, are we?
Woah, rad shirts!
What are those for?
They're for our band.
You guys are in a band? "Mordecai and the Rigbys"?
That's so cool.
No, no, no, we're not in a band, heh...
So, what, it's some sort of fake band?
No, it's a real band, but just...
not a big deal, you know?
Your band should play the open mic tomorrow night!
Yeah, for sure, uh... totally.
Awesome. I can't wait to see you guys play.
Well, I guess I'll see you then.
Yeah... see you then...
then.
What was that, man?!
I dunno!
I just didn't want her to think we had a stupid fake band!
But now we gotta play that open mic tomorrow!
OK, OK, we can totally do this.
We just gotta learn one song by tomorrow night.
One song? - One song.
Ready? - Shreddy.
One, two, three, four!
OK, stop, stop.
We need help.
A two-man ensemble?
What a charming idea!
How'd you learn to be so good, Pops?
Throw these records on the old talking machine
and you'll be ready for your open mic in no time!
Agh, you know about the open mic night?
we're all going to be there!
Wait. If we're gonna learn this in time, then you gotta take this seriously.
What? - Put on the shirt.
Fine. Play the record.
So, you want to become a musician? Bravo!
Now, what is the first thing all good musicians require?
Talent?
Yes!
Good personal hygiene...
is the key  to becoming a successful gentleman musician!
This is gonna take like ten years!
Yeah, and there's still two more after this one!
There's gotta be a faster way.
...all washed up? Good!
All three at once? - Now just locate your...
...one, two, three... A minor seventh... Harmonic can be tapped...
Dude, this isn't working! I can't understand anything.
Dude, we gotta keep going.
Do you wanna look like an idiot at the open mic?
What was that?
Dude, what's happening?! - I don't know!
Dude, who are you guys?
We're Mordecai and Rigby.
Who the blazes are you?
Just kiddin'. We know who you are.
Coz we're you in ten years!
You don't know it yet,
but this is the moment  where we teach you how to rock!
Dude, this is perfect!
Wait, wait. We suck,
and if you're us, doesn't that mean you suck too?
Didn't you just hear us play?
Yeah, we're super-successful musicians in the future.
Yeah, look at us, dude! We're wearing sunglasses!
Our future's so bright, we gotta wear shades.
Awesome!
Oh, hey - in the future,
do we get that thing we always wanted?
Oh, we got it.
Awesome!
in the future, do I get to go out with Margaret?
I wouldn't wanna ruin the surprise.
Look.
We promise we'll get you ready for tomorrow night's gig
if you're willing to put in the work.
Yeah, whatever it takes.
We said the same thing ten years ago.
Awesome! Let's rock!
That's it. You're ready!
What?
But we never learned how to play!
We haven't even picked up a guitar.
we got the look, we've got the moves down,
I know the lyrics backwards and forwards.
Just teach us how to play!
Don't worry. You know enough. You're gonna be fine!
Besides, it's too late to teach you anything else.
Gig's in 20 minutes.
We're screwed.
♪ You're my sweet little baby, ♪
♪ and I think I might be crazy for you... ♪
I can't believe they're gonna play tonight.
Those two slackers have never even picked up an instrument.
This is gonna be a trainwreck.
Woo, I love trains!
♪ ...my sweet little baby, and I think I might be crazy for you. ♪
Dang!
Yeah.
Should I hand out the last of the t-shirts?
You brought the t-shirts?!
Yeah, for the fans.
Dude, we don't even have any fans.
You guys look like rock stars.
Hey, can I have one of those?
Uh, yeah...
Here's a small.
How do I look?
Amazing.
I can hand these out for you guys.
Get everyone pumped for the closing act.
Closing act?!
Yeah, save the best for last!
Well, break a leg, guys. I can't wait.
And finally, give it up for Mordecai and the Rigbys!
Yeah, come on! - Sorry we're late.
Where've you guys been?!
We had to get you these...
Picks?! But we still don't even know how to play!
Just go out there, you'll be great.
Just like we were ten years ago.
But... - Crowd's waitin'! Go on!
Come on, ladies, play us a tasty lick!
Holy crap!

You can stop now.
Wait, wait. I can explain, I can explain!
We were lip-synching.
Hey, look, I don't blame you.
We thought we could just order some t-shirts
and pass ourselves off as a band.
But it turns out playing music's really hard to do.
We just got caught up in the dream, man.
And just for a little while it was real.
But that's over.
And lip-synching's not cool.
So we're breaking up the band.
Why'd you stop? It was going great.
You tricked us into lip-synching!
Look. We've become rich and famous because of lip-synching.
Don't you wanna be a part of that?
No, that's lame!
You may be me, but that's not the me I wanna be.
Me neither!
Mordecai and the Rigbys is over.
OK, dude! Think about what you're doing!
Yeah, stop, man!
If you break up the band, what are we gonna do in the future?!
I wouldn't wanna ruin the surprise.
Nooo!
Yeah! Alright!
I don't know why you thought this open mic would be embarrassing.
This is awesome!
Mordecai! Mordecai!
Margaret! Margaret!
Mordecai! - Margaret!
That was pretty cool, what you said up there!
Thanks, Margaret.
Oh, hey, have you met my new boyfriend, Angel?
C'mon, baby.
We don't wanna be late for our dinner reserva-ations!
Oh, yeah. See you, guys!
Oh, Angel, you have such a great voice.
Maybe you should have just kept lip-synching.
