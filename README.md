This project used Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods on Regular Show Season 1 (2010) scripts.

The aim of this project is to find the dominant sentiments that appear in Regular Show Season 1 (2010), to create a WordCoud to visualise the most used word in the show, and to identify the vocabulary richness, readability and sentence length of the characters in the show. Based on the aims, the analysis includes:


    1. Sentiment Analysis
    2. Wordcloud
    3. Vocabulary richness (Type-Token Ratio (TTR)), Readability (Flesch-Kincaid Grade) and Sentence length


The analysis is carried out using R.
