This project used Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods on Regular Show Season 1 (2010) scripts. The Regular Show is an animated show starring two friends, Mordecai (a blue jay) and Rigby (a raccoon). This show was played on Cartoon Network, a TV channel known for airing shows for kids.

The aim of this project is to find the dominant sentiments that appear in Regular Show Season 1 (2010), to create a WordCoud to visualise the most used word in the show, and to identify the language complexity in the show. Based on the aims, the analysis includes:


    1. Sentiment analysis
    2. Wordcloud analysis
    3. Vocabulary richness (Type-Token Ratio (TTR)), Readability (Flesch-Kincaid Grade) and Sentence length


The analysis is carried out using R.
