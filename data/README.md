from dataset publisher: The mean humor ratings are freely available as part of our dataset. The data can be accessed at https://github.com/tomasengelthaler/HumorNorms , downloadable as a.csv file. The sheet is organized alphabetically, by word label. It includes the mean humor rating for all participants combined (mean_ALL), along with the standard deviation (sd_ALL) and the number of participants rating a word (n_ALL). The same three variables are available exclusively for participants identifying as male (mean_M/sd_M/n_M) and for those identifying as female (mean_F/sd_F/n_F). Additionally, the variables are also presented according to the median split of age, dividing participants into a younger group (age â‰¤32; mean_young/sd_young/n_young) and an older group (age >32; mean_old/sd_old/n_old).










# justify why we are using the rating from the second dataframe.
# because the first dataframe was based on the family guy show
# meanwhile the second dataframe was based on a study where people rated the level of humour they think a word has
